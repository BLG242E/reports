This is a laboratory course that includes the design and implementation of logic circuits. Combinational and sequential (synchronous and asynchronous) circuit design examples using small and medium level integrated circuits, PAL (Programmable Array Logic) / PLA (Programmable Logic Arrays) programming software are also used. In groups of 3 people, we set up our circuits using an electronic circuit board & Vivado Language. Then wrote the reports of each circuit.

Here we have our experiments' instruction files, and our experiment codes's explanations in the reports, divided to folders according to corresponding weeks.
